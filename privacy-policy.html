        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>This notice describes our privacy policies and procedures in safeguarding information about customers and former customers that obtain insurance products or services for personal, family or household purposes. Please note that if state law is more protective of an individual's privacy than federal privacy law, we will protect information in accordance with state law while also meeting federal requirements.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect and maintain personal information to provide you with coverage, products or services and to service your account.</p>
        <p>We collect certain information ("nonpublic personal information") about you and the members of your household from the following sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information you provide on applications or other forms, such as your social security number, assets, income, and property information;</li>
            <li>Information about your transactions with us, such as your policy coverage, premiums, and payment history;</li>
            <li>Information from your visits to our website or other websites we operate, use of our mobile sites and applications, and interaction with our online advertisements;</li>
            <li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency or insurance support organization, such as motor vehicle records, credit report information and claims history; and</li>
            <li>If you obtain a life, long-term care or disability product, information we receive from you, medical professionals who have provided care to you and insurance support organizations, regarding your health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
        <p>We restrict access to personal information about you to individuals, such as our employees and agents, who provide you with our products and services. We require individuals with access to your customer information to protect it and keep it confidential. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable regulatory standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you except as described in this notice.</p>

        <h2>Information We Disclose</h2>
        <p>We may disclose the nonpublic personal information we collect about you to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements and to other third parties, all as permitted by law.</p>
        <p>We are permitted to disclose personal health information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To process your transaction with us, for instance, to determine eligibility for coverage, to process claims or to prevent fraud;</li>
            <li>With your written authorization, and</li>
            <li>Otherwise as permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choice</h2>
        <p>If you prefer that we not share consumer report information with our partners, except as otherwise permitted by law, you may request an Opt-Out Form by calling us at <strong>918-600-2022</strong> or emailing <strong>Sales@ry.agency</strong>. A form will be mailed to your attention. Please verify that all of your policy numbers are listed. If not, please add the policy numbers on the form and mail to the return address printed on the form. We will implement your request within a reasonable time after we receive the form.</p>

        <h2>Modifications to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to change our privacy practices in the future, which may include sharing nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties. Before we make any changes, we will provide you with a revised privacy notice and give you the opportunity to opt-out of that type of information sharing.</p>

        <h2>Website Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our website contains additional information about website use. Please review those notices if you transmit personal information to us over the Internet.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Our policy is to restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you only to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you or to provide necessary technical support. We require employees with access to your nonpublic personal information to use safeguards against unauthorized access, use and unlawful disclosure. We require our employees to adhere to high standards of ethics and integrity in performing their jobs and conducting business.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>When you visit our website, we may collect information about your activities. We use cookies to help manage online advertising and to provide you with a more customized service. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer's hard drive. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain functions.</p>

        <h2>Right to Preserve and Disclose</h2>
        <p>We may preserve for any period of time all information you provide. We may also disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) complete your transaction; (b) comply with legal process; (c) enforce our agreement; (d) respond to claims that any materials violate your rights or the rights of third parties; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Robert Yocom Agency, its users and/or the public; or (f) in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party.</p>
